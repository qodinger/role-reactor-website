## 🎯 Quick Start Example

Let's create a simple role message that your members can use right away.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Choose Your Roles

First, decide what roles you want members to be able to assign themselves. For this example, we'll use:

- **🎮 Gamer** - For gaming enthusiasts
- **🎨 Artist** - For creative members  
- **💻 Developer** - For tech-minded people

<Callout type="info">
**Make sure these roles exist** in your server before creating the role message! Go to Server Settings > Roles to create them if needed.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step>

### Create the Role Message

In any channel where you want the role message to appear, type:

```
/setup-roles title:"Choose Your Roles" description:"React below to assign yourself roles!" roles:"🎮:Gamer,🎨:Artist,💻:Developer"
```

**What this does:**
- Creates a message titled "Choose Your Roles"
- Adds a description explaining what to do
- Sets up 3 emoji-role pairs (🎮 for Gamer, 🎨 for Artist, 💻 for Developer)

</Step>
<Step>

### Test It Out!

1. **Look for the new message** that appeared
2. **Click the 🎮 reaction** - you should get the "Gamer" role
3. **Check your role list** in the member sidebar
4. **Remove the reaction** to remove the role

<Callout type="check">
**It worked!** Your members can now self-assign roles by reacting to your message!
</Callout>

</Step>
</Steps>

## 🎨 Making It Look Better

Let's improve the appearance with a custom color and better description:

<Tabs items={['Command', 'Result']}>
<Tab value="Command">

```
/setup-roles title:"🌟 Community Roles" description:"**Welcome to our server!**\n\nChoose roles that match your interests:\n\n• 🎮 Gaming enthusiasts\n• 🎨 Creative minds\n• 💻 Tech lovers" roles:"🎮:Gamer,🎨:Artist,💻:Developer" color:"#7289DA"
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="Result">

```
🌟 Community Roles

Welcome to our server!

Choose roles that match your interests:

• 🎮 Gaming enthusiasts
• 🎨 Creative minds  
• 💻 Tech lovers

🎮 🎨 💻
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

**New features used:**
- **Custom color** (`#7289DA` - Discord's blue)
- **Bold text** with `**bold**`
- **Line breaks** with `\n`  
- **Bullet points** with `•`

## 📱 Understanding the Results

When you create a role message, here's what your members will see:

### How Members Use It
1. **See the message** in the channel
2. **Read the description** to understand what each emoji means
3. **Click emoji reactions** to get roles
4. **Remove reactions** to remove roles
5. **Check their profile** to see new roles

## 🗂️ Organizing with Categories

For servers with many roles, organize them into categories:

<Tabs items={['Command', 'Result']}>
<Tab value="Command">

```
/setup-roles title:"Server Roles" description:"Choose your roles by category!" roles:"#Gaming\n🎮:Gamer,🎲:Board Games,🕹️:Retro Gaming\n#Creative\n🎨:Artist,📸:Photographer,✍️:Writer" color:"#43AA8B"
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="Result">

```
Server Roles

Choose your roles by category!

─────── Gaming ───────
🎮 Gaming enthusiasts
🎲 Board game lovers
🕹️ Retro gaming fans

─────── Creative ───────
🎨 Artists and designers
📸 Photography enthusiasts
✍️ Writers and storytellers

🎮 🎲 🕹️ 🎨 📸 ✍️
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## 🔧 Quick Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"The bot didn't respond to my command"**
- Make sure the bot has permission to send messages in that channel
- Check that you typed the command correctly (start with `/setup-roles`)

**"Members can't get roles when they react"**
- Verify the role names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check that the bot's role is above the roles it's trying to assign
- Ensure the bot has "Manage Roles" permission

**"The emoji reactions didn't appear"**
- The bot needs "Add Reactions" permission
- Custom emojis might not be available to the bot

### Quick Fixes

1. **Check bot permissions** in channel settings
2. **Verify role hierarchy** in Server Settings > Roles
3. **Test with simple role names** (avoid special characters)
