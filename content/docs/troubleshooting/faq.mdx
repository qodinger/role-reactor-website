Use our invitation link with pre-configured permissions. You need "Manage Server" permission to add bots to your Discord server.

**Required permissions include:**
- **Manage Roles** - To assign/remove roles from members
- **Add Reactions** - To react with emojis on messages
- **Read Message History** - To detect when members react
- **Send Messages** - To respond to commands and confirmations

### What permissions does the bot need?

<Tabs items={['Essential Permissions', 'Recommended Permissions', 'Advanced Features']}>
  <Tab value="Essential Permissions">
    **Required for basic functionality:**
    
    - ‚úÖ **Manage Roles** - Core function for role assignment
    - ‚úÖ **Add Reactions** - React with emojis to create role buttons
    - ‚úÖ **Read Message History** - Detect member reactions
    - ‚úÖ **View Channel** - Access channels where role messages exist
    - ‚úÖ **Send Messages** - Respond to commands and confirmations
    
    **Without these permissions, the bot cannot function properly.**
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="Recommended Permissions">
    **Enhance bot functionality:**
    
    - üî∏ **Use External Emojis** - Access emojis from other servers
    - üî∏ **Embed Links** - Rich message formatting
    - üî∏ **Attach Files** - Share images and documents
    - üî∏ **Use Application Commands** - Slash command functionality
    
    **These permissions improve user experience but aren't strictly required.**
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="Advanced Features">
    **For advanced server management:**
    
    - üîπ **Mention Everyone** - For announcement roles only
    - üîπ **Manage Messages** - Clean up and organize (staff only)
    - üîπ **Create Instant Invite** - For community building features
    
    **Use these carefully and only grant to trusted bot roles.**
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### The bot isn't responding to my commands. What's wrong?

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Wait a few minutes**
    Slash commands can take time to appear after adding the bot or updates.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Check bot permissions**
    Ensure the bot has required permissions in the channel and server.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Try a different channel**
    Some channels might have restrictions on bot commands.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Verify bot is online**
    Look for green status in the member list.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Can I use the bot for free?

**Yes!** Role Reactor Bot is completely free to use in your Discord server. Just invite it and start creating role messages immediately.

## Setting Up Roles

### How many roles can I put in one message?

<Callout type="warning">
**Recommended limits for best user experience:**
- **Maximum 20 roles** per message for readability
- **Use categories** to organize large role sets  
- **Create multiple messages** for different types of roles
</Callout>

**Organization strategies:**

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="üì± Mobile-Friendly"
    description="Keep role messages compact for mobile users - they'll see everything clearly without excessive scrolling"
  />
  <Card
    title="üéØ Logical Grouping"
    description="Group related roles together (gaming, notifications, hobbies) for intuitive organization"
  />
  <Card
    title="‚ö° Quick Selection"
    description="Members should be able to scan and select roles quickly without decision fatigue"
  />
</Cards>

### Can members get multiple roles from the same message?

**Yes!** Members can react to multiple emojis and get all corresponding roles. This is the default behavior and allows for:

- **Interest combinations** - Gaming + Art + Music roles
- **Notification preferences** - Multiple update types
- **Activity levels** - Various engagement preferences
- **Personality traits** - Multiple characteristic roles

### Why can't the bot assign certain roles?

**The bot can only assign roles that are below its own role in your server's hierarchy.**

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Check role hierarchy**
    Go to Server Settings > Roles to view the role order.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Move bot role higher**
    Drag the "Role Reactor Bot" role above any roles you want it to manage.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Test role assignment**
    Try assigning a role to verify the hierarchy fix worked.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Update permissions**
    Ensure the bot still has "Manage Roles" permission after changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What happens if I delete a role that's used in a role message?

The emoji will still appear in the message, but the bot will log errors when members try to react.

**Solution:** Use the update command to remove the deleted role from the message configuration.

### Can I use custom emojis from other servers?

<Tabs items={['Custom Emoji Usage', 'Limitations', 'Best Practices']}>
  <Tab value="Custom Emoji Usage">
    **Yes, but with considerations:**
    
    - ‚úÖ **Bot can use any emoji** it has access to
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Members need Discord Nitro** to react with external emojis
    - üî∏ **Server-specific emojis** work for all members
    - üí° **Unicode emojis** are universally accessible
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="Limitations">
    **Potential issues:**
    
    - **Nitro dependency** - Non-Nitro members can't react to external emojis
    - **Emoji availability** - If source server removes access, emoji breaks
    - **Mobile limitations** - Some custom emojis display poorly on mobile
    - **Accessibility concerns** - Complex emojis may be hard to distinguish
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="Best Practices">
    **Recommendations:**
    
    - **Prioritize server emojis** - Create custom emojis in your own server
    - **Use Unicode as backup** - Always have standard emoji alternatives
    - **Test across devices** - Verify emoji appearance on mobile and desktop
    - **Consider accessibility** - Choose clear, distinguishable emojis
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## For Server Members

### How do members get roles?

**Simple 4-step process:**

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Find the role message**
    Located in your server's dedicated roles channel or as pinned messages.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Click the emoji reaction**
    Choose the emoji that corresponds to the role you want.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Get the role instantly**
    The bot automatically assigns the role within seconds.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Remove reaction to remove role**
    Click the emoji again to toggle the role off.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Do members need special permissions to get roles?

**No special permissions needed!** Any member can react to get roles, unless you've specifically restricted the ability to add reactions in that channel.

**Channel requirements:**
- Members must be able to see the channel
- Members must have "Add Reactions" permission
- No additional Discord permissions required

### Can members see what each emoji does?

**Yes, with clear descriptions!** Write helpful explanations in your role messages:

```
üéØ Choose your interests:

üéÆ Gaming enthusiasts - Access gaming channels and LFG
üé® Creative minds - Join art showcases and feedback
üíª Tech lovers - Discuss programming and gadgets

React below: üéÆ üé® üíª
```

**Effective description tips:**
- **Be specific** about what the role provides
- **Mention channel access** or special permissions

    - **Member education** - Explain the role system in welcome messages
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Temporary Roles

### How do temporary roles work?

**Automated time-limited role assignment:**

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Assignment with duration**
    Use `/assign-temp-role` to give someone a role for a specific time period.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Automatic tracking**
    The bot tracks expiration times and manages removal automatically.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Automatic removal**
    When time expires, the role is removed without manual intervention.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Optional early removal**
    Staff can remove temporary roles before expiration if needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What duration formats can I use?

**Supported time formats:**

| Format | Duration | Best For | Example Use |
|--------|----------|----------|-------------|
| `30m` | 30 minutes | Quick events | Flash sales, short announcements |
| `2h` | 2 hours | Medium events | Movie nights, gaming sessions |
| `1d` | 1 day | Daily access | Contest winners, daily perks |
| `1w` | 1 week | Weekly trials | VIP access, weekly rewards |
| `4w` | 4 weeks (max) | Extended trials | Monthly memberships, long trials |

### What happens if the bot goes offline with active temporary roles?

**Roles still expire correctly** when the bot comes back online. Expiration times are stored in the database and processed when the bot restarts.

**Reliability features:**
- **Persistent storage** - Times saved even during outages
- **Catch-up processing** - Expired roles removed on restart
- **No role accumulation** - System prevents "stuck" temporary roles
- **Logging maintained** - Full audit trail of temporary role activities

### Can I extend a temporary role?

**Current process requires reassignment:**

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Remove existing temporary role**
    Use the remove command to clear the current temporary assignment.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Assign new temporary role**
    Create a new temporary role assignment with the desired total duration.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Consider upgrade path**
    For valuable members, consider making the role permanent instead.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Role Messages

### How do I update an existing role message?

**Use the update command with the message ID:**

```
/update-roles message_id:123456789 title:"New Title" description:"Updated description"
```

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Find the message ID**
    - Enable Developer Mode in Discord settings
    - Right-click the role message
    - Select "Copy ID"
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Use update command**
    - Include the message ID in your update command
    - Specify which elements to change
    - Test the update in a safe environment first
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Verify changes**
    - Check that the message displays correctly
    - Test role assignment functionality
    - Ensure all emojis still work properly
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Can I delete a role message?

**Yes, use `/delete-roles message_id:123456789`**

<Callout type="warning">
**Important:** This only removes the bot's functionality. Members keep any roles they already have from that message.
</Callout>

**Post-deletion considerations:**
- **Member roles remain** - Existing role assignments aren't affected
- **No new assignments** - Members can't get roles from deleted messages
- **Clean up process** - Consider if you want to remove existing roles manually
- **Replacement planning** - Create new role messages if still needed

### How do I see all my role messages?

**Use `/list-roles`** to see all role assignment messages in your server, including:

- **Message IDs** for editing and management
- **Channel locations** where each message exists
- **Role counts** and configuration details
- **Creation dates** and last modification times

### Can I move a role message to a different channel?

**No direct move option available.** You'll need to recreate:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Create new message**
    Set up the role message in the desired channel with the same configuration.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Test functionality**
    Verify that role assignment works correctly in the new location.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Update references**
    Change any pins, welcome messages, or links that reference the old message.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Delete old message**
    Remove the original message once the new one is working properly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customization

### Can I change the appearance of role messages?

**Extensive customization options available:**

<Tabs items={['Colors & Formatting', 'Organization', 'Emojis']}>

    - **External emojis** (from other servers - requires Nitro)
    - **Animated emojis** (dynamic but requires Nitro)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### How do I organize roles into categories?

**Use the category format in your roles parameter:**

```
roles:"#Gaming\nüéÆ:Gamer,üé≤:Board Games\n#Creative\nüé®:Artist,üì∏:Photographer"
```

**This creates visual sections:**

```
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Gaming ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
üéÆ üé≤

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Creative ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
