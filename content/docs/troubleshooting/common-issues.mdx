## üîß Quick Diagnostics

### Role Assignment Issues

**Step-by-Step Diagnosis:**

1. **Check Bot Status**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Is the bot online?
   ‚úÖ Can others get roles from the same message?
   ‚úÖ Do other bot commands work?
   ```

2. **Verify Message Configuration**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Are you clicking reactions below the message?
   ‚úÖ Do the role names match exactly?
   ‚úÖ Has the message been updated recently?
   ```

3. **Check Your Permissions**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Can you add reactions to other messages?
   ‚úÖ Do you meet server verification requirements?
   ‚úÖ Are there any role restrictions in place?
   ```

4. **Test Alternative Methods**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Try a different device/browser
   ‚úÖ Test in private/incognito mode
   ‚úÖ Ask a friend to test the same message
   ```

### Command Failures

**When `/setup-roles` or other commands don't work:**

<Callout type="warn">
**Permission Check:** You need "Manage Roles" permission to use admin commands.
</Callout>

**Common Causes:**
- Missing permissions
- Incorrect command syntax
- Bot lacking required permissions
- Role names don't match Discord roles

**Quick Fixes:**
1. Verify you have "Manage Roles" permission
2. Check command syntax carefully
3. Ensure role names match exactly (case-sensitive)
4. Try the command in a different channel

## üè• Emergency Fixes

### When Nothing Works

**Complete Reset Procedure:**

1. **User-Level Reset**
   ```
   1. Log out of Discord completely
   2. Clear browser cache/restart app
   3. Log back in and wait 2-3 minutes
   4. Test role assignment again
   ```

2. **Channel-Level Reset** (Admins)
   ```
   1. Check bot permissions in channel
   2. Remove and re-add bot to channel
   3. Update role message if necessary
   4. Test with a simple role message
   ```

3. **Server-Level Reset** (Admins)
   ```
   1. Check bot's server permissions
   2. Verify role hierarchy
   3. Remove and re-invite bot if necessary
   4. Recreate problematic role messages
   ```

### When Roles Disappear

**If members lose roles unexpectedly:**

<Callout type="info">
**Don't Panic:** Role loss is usually temporary and can be restored.
</Callout>

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Check if roles were manually removed by staff
2. Verify role messages are still active
3. Look for server boost level changes
4. Check Discord audit log for role changes

**Recovery Steps:**
1. Ask affected members to re-react to role messages
2. Use `/assign-temp-role` for urgent cases
3. Check for recent bot updates or server changes
4. Contact support if mass role loss occurred
