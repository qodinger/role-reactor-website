### Role Creation Best Practices

<Tabs items={['Naming Conventions', 'Visual Organization', 'Permission Setup', 'Member Education']}>
  <Tab value="Naming Conventions">
    **Clear and consistent naming:**
    
    **Good examples:**
    ```
    ✅ Gaming Discussions
    ✅ Art & Design  
    ✅ Book Club Member
    ✅ Event Notifications
    ✅ Night Owl
    ```
    
    **Avoid these patterns:**
    ```
    ❌ Gaming (too vague)
    ❌ Art/Design (inconsistent punctuation)
    ❌ Books (doesn't indicate participation)
    ❌ Events (unclear purpose)
    ❌ Late Night (less fun than Night Owl)
    ```
    
    **Naming guidelines:**
    - Use descriptive, clear language
    - Maintain consistent formatting
    - Consider emoji additions for visual appeal
    - Avoid abbreviations that might confuse
    - Test names with new members for clarity
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="Visual Organization">
    **Color coding strategy:**
    
    ```
    🔴 Administration & Moderation
    🟠 Special Access & VIP
    🟡 Notifications & Announcements  
    🟢 Interest & Hobby Roles
    🔵 Activity & Participation Levels
    🟣 Fun & Personality Roles
    ⚫ Temporary & Event Roles
    ```
    
    **Hierarchy positioning:**
    - Staff roles at the top
    - Bot roles below staff but above members
    - Special access roles in upper middle
    - General member roles in lower middle
    - Fun/personality roles near bottom
    - @everyone role at the bottom
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="Permission Setup">
    **Safe permissions for self-assigned roles:**
    
    **✅ Recommended permissions:**
    - View channels (specific channels only)
    - Send messages (in designated channels)
    - Add reactions
    - Use external emojis
    - Connect to voice channels
    - Speak in voice channels
    
    **⚠️ Use with caution:**
    - Mention @everyone (for announcement roles only)
    - Manage messages (moderator roles only)
    - Create instant invites (trusted members only)
    
    **❌ Never for self-assigned roles:**
    - Administrator
    - Manage roles
    - Kick/ban members
    - Manage channels
    - Manage server
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="Member Education">
    **Help members understand the system:**
    
    **Welcome message template:**
    ```
    📌 **Welcome to our role system!**
    
    🎯 **Getting roles**: React to emojis in #roles
    🔄 **Changing roles**: Remove reactions to remove roles
    💬 **New channels**: Roles unlock special channels
    🔔 **Notifications**: Control what pings you get
    ❓ **Questions**: Ask in #help!
    
    🌟 **Recommended starter roles:**
    • 📢 Server News - Important updates
    • 💬 General Chat - Main discussions
    • [Your main interest] - Join your hobby group
    ```
