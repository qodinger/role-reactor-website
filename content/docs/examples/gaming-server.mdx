## Step-by-Step Setup
1. List the main platforms and game genres in your community.
2. Assign clear emoji to each platform and genre.
3. Use the `/setup-roles` command with the following roles string:

    ```markdown
    #Platforms
    🖥️:PC Gaming
    🎮:PlayStation
    🎮:Xbox
    📱:Mobile
    #Games
    🔫:FPS
    ⚔️:RPG
    🏎️:Racing
    🎲:Strategy
    ```
4. Encourage members to react to get access to game-specific channels or notifications.

## Example Role Message

#Platforms
🖥️:PC Gaming
🎮:PlayStation
